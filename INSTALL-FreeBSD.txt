FreeBSD is basically the same as Mac and Linux, but you need to make a
couple minor changes in the Makefiles. Specifically:

Open-Transactions/OTLib/Makefile
Open-Transactions/transaction/Makefile
Open-Transactions/testwallet/Makefile.testwallet



===> STEP ONE:


In all three Makefiles, find the below section:


--- BEGIN SECTION --- 
#
# Make sure the first directory below has YOUR computer's path to the
# OpenSSL include files. This is the one I use for Mac and Linux:
#
#        -I/usr/local/ssl/include \    
#
# Or, if you prefer, the FreeBSD path to the OpenSSL include files:
#
#        -I/usr/local/include \  
#

INCLUDEDIRS = \
	-I/usr/local/ssl/include \
--- END SECTION ---



Notice the instructions inside the above code, to substitute one directory
path for another, in the event that you are running FreeBSD.

Make the substitution as described, in ALL THREE Makefiles.




===> STEP TWO:

In the transaction and testwallet Makefiles, add one line to the library dirs:


HERE'S HOW IT LOOKS FOR MAC AND LINUX: 
# For FreeBSD, add this library:  /usr/ports/security/openssl/work/openssl-1.0.0a
LIBDIRS = \
	-L../OTLib

HERE'S HOW IT *SHOULD* LOOK FOR FREEBSD:
LIBDIRS = \
	-L/usr/ports/security/openssl/work/openssl-1.0.0a
	-L../OTLib


(Notice an extra library path was added for FreeBSD.)




===> That's it!  Now follow the Mac / Linux instructions to finish the build!
