OpenTransactions


 --- Open Transactions is currently built on:
     - Mac OSX 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard)
     - Ubuntu Linux 2.6.32.
 
 --- OpenSSL version 1.0.0a (at least) is necessary, since the SAMY hash 
     uses WHRLPOOL. (XOR'd with SHA-512.) WHIRLPOOL is a new addition to 
     OpenSSL.
 
 --- Let me know if there are any problems, since this is new software; this 
     will be a living document.
 



TO BUILD:

--- Make sure OpenSSL 1.0.0a is installed, earlier versions don't have
    WHIRLPOOL.

--- Find libssl.a and libcrypto.a and copy them to the OTLib folder.

--- cd (change directory) to the Open-Transactions folder.

--- Edit (using vi or whatever) transaction/server.cpp and search for the
    word REDACTED. When you find it, fix the path there to whatever is
    appropriate for your system. This bit of hardcoding will be removed in
    a future release, but for now, it's necessary.

--- Build the Library:
cd OTLib;
make

--- Build the server:
cd ../transaction;
make

--- Build the client:
cd ../testwallet;
make




--- Make sure! You have at least version 1.0.0a of OpenSSL installed.

   (HOW did I install OpenSSL?  My Mac already came with an old version of it.
   So first I downloaded the OpenSSL latest build, and followed the instructions
   to install that. I also installed a program called "MacPorts" (google it) and
   used that to install OpenSSL as well, which went into the /opt folder. 
   I also had to search my computer for libssl.a and libcrypto.a (using 
   spotlight in finder) and, after backing up the old files, I overwrote them 
   with the new ones. I did the same for the header files and the dylib files.  
   Most notably, the Mac development version of OpenSSL is in the /Developer 
   SDK folders. I replaced the headers and libraries and dylibs in there and 
   wherever else I could find that I could replace them.  I got the NEW dylib 
   files from the MacPorts install, and I got the NEW .a files from the OpenSSL 
   download and build.  Make sure the "make install" for the OpenSSL download 
   is done using sudo. sudo make install.) 
    



TO RUN:

The client and server expect to be run from the command line in the same folder 
as the .xcodeproj file is in (ie each prefers its own main folder.) 
For either:

cd testwallet       (for client) 
-- OR -- 
cd transaction      (for server)

(Assuming you have already built the projects, including OTLib first.)



EXECUTING THE BINARIES:

If you are in the transaction folder, then run it like this:
./transaction


if you are in the testwallet folder, then run the wallet like this:
./testwallet


I have to fix the path and config file stuff, and I just haven't done it yet, 
so YOU have to make sure you are in the right folder when you run it.


You don't have to specify a hostname and port, because the server contract
already contains that information.

In the server contract that comes with this test distribution,
the hostname is localhost and port is 7085



USING THE SOFTWARE:

I already created your user account. The password is test (always)

==> With the server, all you can do is watch the output as it runs.

==> But with the client, there is a command-line interface. 

**** READ:  docs/CLIENT-COMMANDS.txt  for a list of the Wallet's commands.
I will soon add that file to a help command inside the wallet.
You can create asset accounts, issue new asset types, 
transfer assets, get inbox, process inbox,
withdraw cash, deposit cash, getcontract, getmint.
You can also create basket currencies and exchange between normal asset accounts
and basket accounts. (To the server it's just another account type.)

REMEMBER: If you move some assets, and you don't see the change show up in your 
account, then you probably just need to type "get" (to get the latest copy of 
the account after a change has just been made.) Another useful command is 'i' 
for grabbing the inbox of any specific account. Then "get", and see the balances
change.

Obviously a nice client will do this automatically.



Let's organize to make a pretty GUI for various platforms, eh?
