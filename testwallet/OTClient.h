							//
							// The server ID is a hash of the server contract. The signature on the contract

							// Simply by importing the server contract into your wallet, you are able to connect
							// to it and encrypt all of your communications to it.
							//
							// Thus, the check server ID command really just confirms what you should already know...
							// Your wallet still wants to see that the server agrees with the server ID, and that
							// the server is able to read messages that were encrypted to the public key in the
							// contract, and that the server is able to sign all of its future correspondence with
							// the same public key.
							//
							// It is the server operator's responsibility to secure the domain name and web host
							// that users will connect to when they import the contract, as well as the private
							// key that matches the public key from the contract.

							// contract is signed by the same key.
		
		createAccount,		// Create an asset account for a certain serverID, UserID, and Asset Type ID.
							// These accounts are where users actually store their digital assets of various
							// types. Account files are stored on user's computer, signed by notary server.
							// Server also maintains its own copy. Users can create an unlimited number of accounts
							// for any asset type that they choose.
		
		issueBasket,		// Create a basket account, which is like an issuer account, but based on a basket of 
							// other asset types. This way, users can trade with what is apparently a single currency, 
							// when in fact the issuence is delegated and distributed across multiple issuers.
		
		exchangeBasket,		// Use this to exchange assets in and out of a basket currency.
