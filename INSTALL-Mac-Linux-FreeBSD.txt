OpenTransactions for Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD


 --- Open Transactions is currently built on:
     - Linux Ubuntu 2.6.32 and FreeBSD using g++/gcc.
     - Mac OS X 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard) using XCode as well as gcc
     - Windows 7 using MS Visual C++ 2010 Express.
     - Android 8 using NDK.
 
 --- OpenSSL version 1.0.0a (at least) is necessary, since the SAMY hash 
     uses WHRLPOOL. (XOR'd with SHA-512.) WHIRLPOOL is a new addition to 
     OpenSSL.
 
 --- Let me know if there are any problems, since this is new software;
     this will be a living document.
 



PRE-BUILD:

--- Make sure OpenSSL 1.0.0a is installed, earlier versions don't have
    WHIRLPOOL.

--- Find libssl.a and libcrypto.a and copy them to the OTLib folder.

--- cd (change directory) to the Open-Transactions folder.

--- Transaction server and client both still have a hardcoded path in the source code. 

    (It's just a DEFAULT path and IS configurable on the command line, 
    so you don't HAVE to do anything about it, if you don't want to.)

    Search the code for the word REDACTED, which appears once in the
    client and once in the server for each platform.

    The relevant source files: transaction/testserver.cpp and 
    testwallet/testclient.cpp
    As well as the new XmlRpc code: transaction/xmlrpcxx_server.cpp and 
    testwallet/xmlrpcxx_client.cpp

    Replace the REDACTED (entire path) with whatever path is appropriate for your system.

On Mac, if you use the XCode project files that I distributed, you have
to fix those as well. (You COULD just use the Makefile, if you prefer.
XCode not necessary.)

They are:
Open-Transactions/OTLib/OTLib.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
Open-Transactions/testwallet/testwallet.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
Open-Transactions/transaction/transaction.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj


So make sure to edit all of those files and correct the paths within by
searching each for the word 'REDACTED'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOW YOU ARE READY TO COMPILE THE CODE:


STEP 1...
For Mac:       cp ./Makefile.darwin ./Makefile
For Linux:     cp ./Makefile.linux ./Makefile
For FreeBSD*:  cp ./Makefile.freebsd ./Makefile

*For FreeBSD, make sure you have gmake installed, since the Makefiles
won't work with the default version of make.

STEP 2...
To build everything, use this command:

    make

If you prefer to build in XmlRpc mode (preferred) then use this instead:
   
    make rpc



---------------------------------------------------------------


If you prefer to build all of the projects individually, they are below for
my notes. But the above step should be enough to take care of everything for
most people.

--- (optional) build the XmlRpc++ library:
cd xmlrpcpp;
make

--- Build the Library:
cd OTLib;
make PLATFORM=[darwin|linux|freebsd]

output will be libOTLib.a
(The other projects/Makefiles will expect that library to be built.)

--- Build the server:
cd ../transaction;
make PLATFORM=[darwin|linux|freebsd] [TRANSPORT=XmlRpc]

--- Build the client:
cd ../testwallet;
make PLATFORM=[darwin|linux|freebsd] [TRANSPORT=XmlRpc]

---------------------------------------------------------------

With the above steps, the library, server, and test client are now built and ready to run.


--- OPTIONAL: Native APIs available for C, C++, C#, Obj-C, Java, Ruby, Python, Perl, Php, Lisp, etc.


cd Open-Transactions/testwallet;
make -f Makefile.API [TRANSPORT=XmlRpc] PLATFORM=[darwin|linux|freebsd] LANGUAGE=[c|csharp|java|ruby|python|perl|php|tcl|lisp]


More detailed notes in Open-Transactions/testwallet/A-README.txt

--------------------------------------------------------

(If you choose to use the XCode project instead of the Makefile, be warned that you have to 
edit the XCode project file to fix the REDACTED issue. You'd also have to deal with dylibs, etc.
Due to this inconvenience, I have insured that the Makefile works the same on Linux and Mac, so you
can avoid XCode for building entirely, if you prefer.)


--- Make sure! You have at least version 1.0.0a of OpenSSL installed.

   (HOW did I install OpenSSL?  My Mac already came with an old version of it. So first I downloaded the OpenSSL latest build, and followed the instructions to install that. I also installed a program called "MacPorts" (google it) and used that to install OpenSSL as well, which went into the /opt folder.  I also had to search my computer for libssl.a and libcrypto.a (using  spotlight in finder) and, after backing up the old files, I overwrote them with the new ones. I did the same for the header files and the dylib files. Most notably, the Mac development version of OpenSSL is in the /Developer SDK folders. I replaced the headers and libraries and dylibs in there and wherever else I could find that I could replace them.  I got the NEW dylib files from the MacPorts install, and I got the NEW .a files from the OpenSSL download and build.  Make sure the "make install" for the OpenSSL download is done using sudo. sudo make install.) 

---------------------------------------------------------

TO RUN:

The client and server expect to be run from the command line in their respective folders. 

cd testwallet       (for client) 
cd transaction      (for server)

(Assuming you have already built the projects, including OTLib first.)


If you are in the transaction folder, then run it like this:
./transaction.exe


if you are in the testwallet folder, then run the wallet like this:
./testwallet.exe


You don't have to specify a hostname and port, because the server contract
already contains that information.

(In the server contract that comes with this test distribution,
the hostname is localhost and port is 7085.)



USING THE SOFTWARE:

I already created your user account. The password is test (always)

==> With the server, all you can do is watch the output as it runs.

==> But with the client, there is a command-line interface. 

**** READ:  docs/CLIENT-COMMANDS.txt  for a list of the Wallet's commands.
I will soon add that file to a help command inside the wallet.
You can create asset accounts, issue new asset types, 
transfer assets, get inbox, process inbox,
withdraw cash, deposit cash, getcontract, getmint.
You can also create basket currencies and exchange between normal 
asset accounts and basket accounts. (To the server it's just another 
account type.)  You can also write and deposit cheques, and withdraw 
vouchers. 

REMEMBER: If you move some assets, and you don't see the change show up in your 
account, then you probably just need to type "get" (to get the latest copy of the 
account after a change has just been made.) Another useful command is 'i' for 
grabbing the inbox of any specific account. Then "get", and then "stat" to see 
the balances change.

Obviously a nice client will do this automatically.



Let's organize to make a pretty GUI for various platforms, eh?
