Welcome to Open Transactions.



GETTING STARTED:

1) See LICENSE-AND-CREDITS file, which should be in the same
   folder as this README file. You agree to the terms.  

2) See INSTALL for instructions on building the 3 projects in XCode.

3) You can *ignore* the ssl folder and the docs/SOCKETNOTES.txt file unless 
   you want to wipe and re-create the test certs and keys for the client and 
   server. (Not recommended.)

   (I have already created test certs for you for client and server.  But if 
   you would like to re-create them, then open docs/SOCKETNOTES.txt I explained
   it all in there.  Otherwise, for testing, you can entirely ignore it and use
   the test keys that I already generated.) 

   THE PASSWORD for ALL the test certs is "test".

4) To run the server, from this folder, type:
       cd transaction; ./transaction
   OR:
       cd transaction; ./build/Debug/transaction

5) To run the test client, from this folder, type:
       cd testwallet; ./testwallet
   OR:
       cd testwallet; ./build/Debug/testwallet

More detailed instructions are in the INSTALL.

password is test (always)
