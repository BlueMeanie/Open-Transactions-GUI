NOTES on the Version:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   0.2 --- Major Release!  ALL NEW:

           JNI Interface (High-level Java API)

           High-level C++ Interface

           !Spent Token Database is fully operational!

           Mints and Tokens now support Expiration AND Series. 

           New Financial Instruments: Cheques and Vouchers.

           Reserve accounts are now working to store the backing funds
           for cash withdrawals and vouchers (cashier's cheques.)

           Transaction numbers are fully working now.
           
           Nym files are now signed (to prevent tampering.)

           Hardcoding of paths was fixed, using config files and
           command-line arguments now, so you can use the software 
           without having to change the code.

           Path separators were improved to support Windows-style paths
           (though I haven't tried to actually build on Windows.)

           Numerous bug fixes. Including a big one: discarding
           token signature after unblinding.


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  0.11 --- Added LINUX support... 

           Added Makefiles, and a few fixes related to Linux. 
           
           OT now runs on TWO platforms: LINUX and Mac OS X.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  0.1  --- The original goal was just proof-of-concept. There are many
           TODOs listed on the project page, as well as throughout the
           code.  But it all works!!!
		   
   A WARNING: This software is brand-spanking-new.  The project has not
yet been audited for security or tested for any extended period of time.
Thus far, it must be considered as for experimental purposes only.
		   
       --- There are still a few values that are hardcoded (in the client
           and the server), unfortunately, but it's all documented and I
           have everything set up already to run, so you don't have to
           mess with them. This will be fixed next release.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The server expects its OWN cert to be in the  transaction/certs folder.
The filename should be the server_user_ID from notaryServer.xml
(I HAVE ALREADY PLACED IT THERE.)

This is the file that includes the server's public AND private key.
