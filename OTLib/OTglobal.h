 *       Lucre          --- Copyright (C) 1999-2009 Ben Laurie.
 *                          http://anoncvs.aldigital.co.uk/lucre/

 *    Open Transactions links to these libraries:
 *    
 *       OpenSSL        --- (Version 0.9.8l at time of writing.)

 *   
 *        This library is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Laurie's license
 *        must also be included and respected, since the code for Lucre is also
 *        included with Open Transactions.
 *        The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any problem with his
 *        license, simply remove the Lucre code. Although there are no other blind
 *        token algorithms in Open Transactions (yet), the other functionality will
 *        continue to operate .
 *    
 *    OpenSSL WAIVER:
 *        This program is released under the AGPL with the additional exemption 
 *    	  that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
