 *        This library is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Laurie's license
 *        must also be included and respected, since the code for Lucre is also
 *        included with Open Transactions.
 *        The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any problem with his
 *        license, simply remove the Lucre code. Although there are no other blind
 *        token algorithms in Open Transactions (yet), the other functionality will
 *        continue to operate .
