 *        This library is also "dual-license", meaning that Ben Laurie's license
 *        must also be included and respected, since the code for Lucre is also
 *        included with Open Transactions.
 *        The Laurie requirements are light, but if there is any problem with his
 *        license, simply remove the Lucre code. Although there are no other blind
 *        token algorithms in Open Transactions (yet), the other functionality will
 *        continue to operate .
 *

 *    	  that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.

 --- Open Transactions is currently built on a Mac OSX 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard)
 
 --- OpenSSL of version at least (Version 0.9.8l) is necessary since the SAMY hash 
     uses WHRLPOOL. (XOR'd with SHA-512.) WHIRLPOOL is a new addition to OpenSSL.
	 
 --- OTLib itself is only a library.  There are also a client and server which use it
     as a dylib, and they expect it to be in /usr/local/lib (at least, according to the
     current xcode project files.)
 
 --- Make sure you link the OTLib library project with libcrypto.a and libssl.a
     (They should already be in the project file that way.)
	 
 --- Let me know if there are any problems, since this is new software; this will be a
     living document.
	
 --- Open the XCode project, build all, and then copy ./build/Debug/libOTLib.dylib to /usr/local/lib.
 
 
 --- AT THIS POINT, YOU SHOULD BE READY TO INSTALL THE CLIENT AND SERVER.
