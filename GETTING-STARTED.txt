Welcome to Open Transactions.



GETTING STARTED:

1) See LICENSE-AND-CREDITS file, which should be in the same
   folder as this README file. You agree to the terms.  

2) See INSTALL for instructions on building the 3 projects.

3) You can *ignore* the ssl folder and the docs/SSL-NOTES.txt file unless 
   you want to wipe and re-create the test certs and keys for the client
   and server. (Not recommended.)

   (I have already created test certs for you for client and server. 
   But if you would like to re-create them, then open docs/SOCKETNOTES.txt 
   I explained it all in there.  Otherwise, for testing, you can entirely
   ignore it and use the test keys that I already generated.) 

   THE PASSWORD for ALL the test certs is "test".

4) To run the server, from this folder, type:
       cd transaction; ./transaction

5) To run the test client, from this folder, type:
       cd testwallet; ./testwallet

** password is test (always) 

** More detailed instructions are in the INSTALL.
